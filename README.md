# CoinMaster

## 2025-04-04

Branch master is unmaintained and the schema is too complicated. Decided to use a real finance tool
like GNUCash or Firefly III instead, and have coinmaster's responsability limited to simple bill deadlines
management and reminding.

Full financial responsability will be passed to wife instead, I only have to worry about paying my
bills on time and ensure that I'm not going into debt (Income vs expense).

### TODO

**NEXT**: configure cfg/.taskrc

- [x] add `--help` option
- [x] add style to help.txt
- [x] list bills
- [x] executing task
- [ ] ready .taskrc
- [ ] import data from old coin.db
- [ ] must be able to send/create email reminders (create email file to pipe/send to sendmail)
- [ ] must be able to export tasks
- [ ] must be able to export reminders (REM syntax)
- [ ] must be able to answer the questions such as: 'am I going into debt?' or 'can I afford it this week?'
